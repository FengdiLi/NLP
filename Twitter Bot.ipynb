Ciao for now and stay tuned. #ConanItaly  EndOfSentence\\nI’m not saying everyone in LA is stoned, but a cop just pulled me over to give me a high 5.

EndOfSentence\\nIf I die suddenly, in order to avoid embarrassment to my family, I’ve designated a friend to destroy my enormous hidden stash of hand-painted pewter wizards. EndOfSentence\\nHere’s why I’m heading to Haiti later this week. #ConanHaiti EndOfSentence\\nIf you are in Washington, D.C., an exciting time to visit the White House is 1-3PM, when they feed live lizards to Stephen Miller.

This is the spread at the Mar-a-Lago New Year’s party!  EndOfSentence\\nI can’t wait until 2017 is over. And 2018, 19, and 20. EndOfSentence\\nAfter what happened to 2017, 2018 is refusing to come out of its room. EndOfSentence\\nA hilarious thing to do when you’re waiting too long for something is roll your eyes and say \"What IS this, the Mueller probe?\" EndOfSentence\\nLet me put an end to the rumors: the creature in \"The Shape of Water\" is not me in hi-def. EndOfSentence\\nMy egg nog koi pond looks beautiful, especially with all the fish resting on the surface oh my God what have I done?

He’s now suing me for breaking his femur. #MerryChristmasEve  EndOfSentence\\nThe most commonly spoken phrase this week in all homes \"Do you have the Scotch tape?\" EndOfSentence\\nNot a good sign: the first thing on Trump’s Christmas list is one of those jackets like Mussolini wore. EndOfSentence\\nIn Seattle for Christmas and there’s only one way to travel: Monorail!!! #Simpsons #HoJu  EndOfSentence\\nStuck on a gift for Senator Mitch McConnell? You can’t go wrong with body glitter. EndOfSentence\\nRich people are really going to take a bath with this new tax plan. In money. They will bathe in money.

EndOfSentence\\nAll I want for Christmas is my two front teeth dipped in gold and turned into drone remotes. EndOfSentence\\nIf the Christmas carolers at my door are really good, I turn my red swivel chair dramatically toward them. EndOfSentence\\nJust received Betsy DeVos’s \"Marry Chrissmiss\" card.

EndOfSentence\\nTrump has been uncharacteristically quiet on Twitter. I bet his staff tricked him with one of these  EndOfSentence\\nJust saw @mulaney at the Orpheum in Los Angeles and I have not laughed that hard in memory. I want to grow up to be that funny someday.

Finally, the 282nd sure thing to bring down the Trump Administration. EndOfSentence\\nA great thing about the new tax plan if you own a race horse, you can write off its genitals as a small business. EndOfSentence\\nThe GOP tax plan can only be read while wearing a monocle and shouting \"Jeeves! Wipe me!\" EndOfSentence\\nFive hundred years ago, it would take months for word of a sitcom’s cancellation to reach Europe. EndOfSentence\\nMay you live in interesting times, like when your vice-president starts picking his vice-president. EndOfSentence\\nI returned a book to the library today and learned they really prefer it to be a book that was previously checked out of a library. EndOfSentence\\nThe trailer for Marvel’s new Avengers movie came out today, and it’s starring every woman in America.

EndOfSentence\\nA Mormon came to my door, and after a long, emotional, and persuasive pitch, I got him to start wearing longer sleeves. EndOfSentence\\nLatest entry in my Gratitude Journal: \"The Altoids people didn’t go into the suppository business.\" EndOfSentence\\nSometimes when things go bad, I only have other people to blame. I love that. EndOfSentence\\nI just heard the Dead Sea Scrolls at the new Bible Museum might be fake & I’m now questioning the authenticity of this \"photograph\" they sold me.  EndOfSentence\\nTrump is already tweeting that Black Friday is the most ungrateful of all the Fridays. EndOfSentence\\nThis year, I’m breaking with tradition a little and stuffing my turkey with delusions of grandeur. EndOfSentence\\nGreat news: scientists have bred a turkey that tastes exactly like tofurkey. EndOfSentence\\nPresident Trump didn’t pardon the whole turkey, just the white meat. EndOfSentence\\nThis week, 90% of all calls and texts are men contacting women in their past to say, \"Are we cool?\" EndOfSentence\\nA few months ago while in Israel, I met a man named Ofer Aloni. He shared a moving story about the loss of his daughter and a song he co-wrote about her with @thekin. It’s called \"The Power to Choose Life.\" Please take a listen.  EndOfSentence\\nStarting to think I shouldn’t have ordered a hot sauce called \"Satan’s Butthole.\" EndOfSentence\\nI gave blood today. It’s more fun when it’s on purpose. EndOfSentence\\nI like to think of myself as \"The Blind Woman’s Ryan Gosling.\" EndOfSentence\\nTook what I thought was a private hike with my friend @kevin_nealon. Now I see this. Sad.

Download to play on your phone. #ad EndOfSentence\\nFall in LA, when the trees get work done to look like they’ve changed color. EndOfSentence\\nI’m starting to think this bobblehead on my desk is nothing but a \"yes-man.\" EndOfSentence\\n\"I’m sure those two drunk guys with knives at the end of the bar will work this out peacefully.\" (Kim Jong Un/Trump Metaphor Tweet) EndOfSentence\\nMe, after my Uber driver asked, \"What’s Andy really like?\"  EndOfSentence\\nI believe that when we die, we all become podcasts. EndOfSentence\\nI’m ready for the all-female reboot of America. EndOfSentence\\nDumbest move of my life: taking a Lyft from NY back to LA. Toyota Yaris.

Enter to be my co-host for a night  EndOfSentence\\nTonight on #ConanNYC, Jon Stewart and I ask each other some bullshit questions.  EndOfSentence\\nOur heroes in uniform stood up for us.

EndOfSentence\\nA real man should know how to order whiskey: on the rocks, in a stemmed glass, and replaced with white wine. EndOfSentence\\n\"The Terminator,\" but he goes back in time to sleep with John Connor’s mom, so he can later just keep reminding John about it. EndOfSentence\\nThis Halloween, I served tricks over treats. I will remember the beatings for the rest of my days. EndOfSentence\\nThe next kid who knocks on my door gets a VHS copy of \"RoboCop 3.\" EndOfSentence\\nPretty excited about my Halloween costume: French Maid With Intimacy Issues Due To Her Recent Breakup With Steve. EndOfSentence\\nJust had a nightmare that I was Justin Turners’ shower drain.  EndOfSentence\\nThis year for Halloween I’m giving out Canadian passports. EndOfSentence\\n\"Clayton Kershaw\" is the sound you make when you cough and sneeze at the same time. EndOfSentence\\nWatch @AaronRodgers12 and I discuss his injury and fight off feral hippos. #CluelessGamer #AssassinsCreedOrigins  EndOfSentence\\nThe only way Trump will pardon the White House Thanksgiving turkey is if it promises to do the same for him in a few months. EndOfSentence\\nJust saw the updated Charlie Brown special where they grind up the Great Pumpkin to flavor someone’s latte. EndOfSentence\\nIt’s only the fifth inning but both the Astros and the Dodgers just left early to beat the traffic. EndOfSentence\\nI get off on pouring good milk down the sink.  EndOfSentence\\nJust got 49 flu shots for $1.99 at Costco. EndOfSentence\\nIt’s exciting that the LA Dodgers will be playing in the World Series, unless of course their pilots get picked up. EndOfSentence\\nWe all done with artichokes? Yeah? Everyone? Full consensus? Good. EndOfSentence\\nI love autumn in L.A., when the leaves change on my screensaver photos. EndOfSentence\\nRest easy America, I just heroically solved the Dave the Horse crisis.  EndOfSentence\\nThis is a terrible day to be on Twitter, please log off. #evergreen EndOfSentence\\nLook, Steve Bannon has a good twin  EndOfSentence\\nThe latest trailer for The Last Jedi blew me away, but why were the first 30 seconds about car insurance? EndOfSentence\\nI liked Blade Runner 2049 but its view of the future was too positive. EndOfSentence\\nJust read another Harvey Weinstein article and now my brain wants an Altoid. EndOfSentence\\nTonight on @colbertlateshow, two sex symbols talk shop.  EndOfSentence\\nBackstage for my appearance on @ColbertLateShow tonight. They told me to take a photo, so I did.  EndOfSentence\\nThe White Stripes sang \"We’re Going To Be Friends\" on my last \"Late Night\" show. It’s one of my favorite memories.  EndOfSentence\\nThe name Red Lobster is helpful if you totally forgot what color lobsters are. EndOfSentence\\nTrying to binge-watch all of the Geico commercials. I’m up to season 117. EndOfSentence\\nGot styled by #Harlem #fashion icon @DapperDanHarlem. This is the before picture. #ConanNYC  EndOfSentence\\nAt @SylviasSoulFood in #Harlem today, I learned that no hairnet can tame me. #ConanNYC  EndOfSentence\\nJust found out all of my childhood bullies were Russian bots. EndOfSentence\\nWill box office numbers adjust for all the men who buy Blade Runner 2049 tickets then \"accidentally\" walk into My Little Pony: The Movie? EndOfSentence\\nIt’s time Dress Barn updated their name to something cool. Like, Gown Silo. EndOfSentence\\nI’m so glad they’re going to make a new Blade Runner movie every 35 years. EndOfSentence\\nPerformed last night with the hilarious @WildHorsesShow. That face I’m making is the first sign of a massive stroke.  EndOfSentence\\nI explored a land of moist wood, no railings, and British Orcs with @kumailn. #CluelessGamer #ShadowOfWar  EndOfSentence\\nThe most disturbing detail about Trump’s new tax plan is the requirement that The Rich audibly click their heels with every million saved. EndOfSentence\\nI was forced to do this by those pricks in Finland. Finland if you’re still reading this, I love you.  EndOfSentence\\nJust got my flu shot. Took three nurses and a guy from the gym. EndOfSentence\\nI used to clear my head of the news by lying back & staring at the clouds but now Trump officials keep flying through them in private jets. EndOfSentence\\nNow I finally get why our national anthem was written by a lawyer. EndOfSentence\\nBest wishes to my Jewish friends who are fasting for Yom Kippur or because they’re trying to make it in Hollywood EndOfSentence\\nI am trying to fire my mime. It’s not going well. EndOfSentence\\nThe cops raided the nail salon in my neighborhood and discovered a better nail salon operating in the back. EndOfSentence\\nHey @nickkroll and @StephenAtHome, this photo was taken the day I replaced David Letterman. #PuberMe #PuertoRicoRelief  EndOfSentence\\nReminder: If your knees are scraped and bleeding, you are playing the oboe incorrectly. EndOfSentence\\nI’m taking the stage at Stand Up for Heroes on Nov 7, but you can help #Give2Veterans now. @Stand4Heroes gets a dollar for every retweet. EndOfSentence\\nThere is nothing more or less worse than when you’re not unable to determinate a tweet’s meaning or not. EndOfSentence\\nWatch me take @TomCruise for a drive and blow his mind.  EndOfSentence\\nTonight on @TBSNetwork, I unveil a revolutionary idea with @TomCruise. Yes, revolutionary. EndOfSentence\\nSince the word \"brink\" gets a raw deal, I’m going to use it in a positive way: I am on the brink of eating a nice fruit salad. EndOfSentence\\nHelp my friend @diegoluna_ get funds to those who need it most in Mexico.  EndOfSentence\\nI’m starting to regret naming my son \"Donald Trump, Jr.\" It seemed okay 11 years ago. EndOfSentence\\nGraham Cassidy: terrible healthcare bill, great name for a folk singer. EndOfSentence\\nMelania Trump may sue over this Croatian billboard. Yesterday she said, \"little bit of English? I happen to know a lottle bit of English.\"  EndOfSentence\\nHappy Rosh Hashanah to @carlreiner and @MelBrooks, if they’re Jewish. EndOfSentence\\nFor my friends in Israel and worldwide, you can watch every clip from #ConanIsrael  EndOfSentence\\nI’m live on YouTube taking your questions and fawning compliments about #ConanIsrael.  EndOfSentence\\nThinking of the great people of Mexico today and of ways to help.  EndOfSentence\\n#ConanIsrael premieres tonight 10/9c on @TBSNetwork. Thanks to the people of Israel for tolerating this creepy goy. EndOfSentence\\nIt’s sad to realize that those dancing gangs in \"West Side Story\" could have just settled their differences through fighting. EndOfSentence\\nThoughts and prayers go out to Lay’s Potato Chips, who are clearly having a nervous breakdown:  EndOfSentence\\nAt home alone, no one here but me and Amazon Alexa. Says she doesn’t want to talk. EndOfSentence\\nThere is nothing wrong with exploring one’s sexuality and that is my message to the California Highway Patrol. EndOfSentence\\nYou can tell the summer is officially over when my dermatologist gives the order to \"Retract Shields.\" EndOfSentence\\nI am now seriously regretting that time I told Equifax how old I actually was when I finally lost my virginity. EndOfSentence\\nHey, wait, I thought I was America’s favorite scary clown. EndOfSentence\\nAutumn in California, where the leaves change color if you use the right Instagram filter.  EndOfSentence\\nKnowing me, when the nuclear bombs fall, I’ll be at CVS, reading the back of a bottle of exfoliating soap. EndOfSentence\\nAhora mismo estoy pensando en todos mis buenos amigos en Mexico. EndOfSentence\\nFor a guy with a billion dollars and a cool car, Elon Musk is kind of a downer. EndOfSentence\\nI think I found a way to get President Trump to read Obama’s powerful statement about #DACA:  EndOfSentence\\nI won’t kill you with kindness, but I will mace you with charm. EndOfSentence\\n\"First of all, Your Honor, I prefer the term ‘penis portraits’....\" EndOfSentence\\nRemember how enthralling and distracting it could be to play with a bubble machine on a lazy summer’s day? Can we get Trump one of those? EndOfSentence\\nToda/Shukran/Thank You to my Israeli, Palestinian & American crews. This show is only possible because of all you fine people. #ConanIsrael  EndOfSentence\\nEnjoyed a beautiful day in #TelAvivJaffa picnicking with an Israeli Arab family. #ConanIsrael #Israel  EndOfSentence\\nBesides being beautiful and talented, @GalGadot is easily the nicest superhero I’ve ever met. #ConanIsrael #Israel #WonderWoman  EndOfSentence\\nWhen in Tel-Aviv... #ConanIsrael  EndOfSentence\\nTalking to Israeli talk show host @alfiguri neck deep in the #SeaofGalilee. I’m the woman on the left. #ConanIsrael #HayomBalayla  EndOfSentence\\nThis is my 7th day in #Israel, my body is 62% hummus. #ConanIsrael  EndOfSentence\\nFilming on the Syrian border where you can hear gunfire between rebels and regime forces.  EndOfSentence\\nMeeting Syrian victims of the civil war being treated at an Israeli hospital near the border. Faces blurred for their safety.  EndOfSentence\\nToday I had my butt kicked by the women of the #IDF Karkl Battalion. That’s me in the middle. #SquadGoals #ConanIsrael #Israel  EndOfSentence\\nFloating in the #DeadSea and enjoying Garfield in Hebrew. #ConanIsrael #Israel  EndOfSentence\\nHad a great time shooting a scene in one of my favorite shows #Fauda. #ConanIsrael  EndOfSentence\\nLearned to dance the #Palestinian way. #Salam #Palestine #Bethlehem  EndOfSentence\\nHanging with some Palestinian children in the West Bank Aida Refugee Camp.

EndOfSentence\\nJust think, 100 years from now, our grandchildren will be taking down Senator Kid Rock statues. EndOfSentence\\nWhen the eclipse comes I’m going to borrow the special glasses my wife uses when I’m shirtless.

He instantly said, \"Martin and Lewis, 1940’s, in a club.\" EndOfSentence\\nCan’t we just go back to being on the brink of nuclear war? EndOfSentence\\nA big hello to new White House communications director Hope Hic what, fired? EndOfSentence\\nI heard the iPhone 15 won’t have any ports or jacks or a screen and it will just be a smooth steel ball and finally we’ll all be happy. EndOfSentence\\nI’m leaving America during this divisive time for the relative peace and quiet of the Middle East. #ConanIsrael EndOfSentence\\n.@TheNotoriousMMA joined us to explain how he’s going to \"dismantle\" @FloydMayweather. #MayweatherMcGregor EndOfSentence\\nOn August 21st, there will be a total eclipse which will look amazing after you miss it and see pics of it online the next day.

EndOfSentence\\nThe only tan I’m getting this summer is a caftan!* *Excerpted from my Golden Girls spec script. EndOfSentence\\nI think it’s wrong to just steal honey from the bees, so I always make sure to leave behind a few \"Late Night with Conan O’Brien\" DVDs. EndOfSentence\\nYou call it day drinking, I call it something unintelligible because I’m day drinking. EndOfSentence\\nThere are three ways to cook a hot dog: Boil, grill, and, I just discovered by accident, dry clean. EndOfSentence\\nDoes this man bun make my unicycle look big? EndOfSentence\\nI still remember summer as a child, when my parents shipped me off to camp for 12 years. EndOfSentence\\nIt’s not fair, people are getting fired so fast at the White House that I don’t get a chance to make fun of them #theMooch EndOfSentence\\nSooner or later, Trump is going to realize that’s just a sack of potatoes in Melania’s bed. EndOfSentence\\nPeople are complaining that Beyoncé’s wax likeness doesn’t look like her, but it’s a much closer match than mine:  EndOfSentence\\nPokémon announced that Legendary Pokémon will appear in gyms in the form of Legendary Eggs. And guess what…nobody gives a legendary crap. EndOfSentence\\nI had the craziest dream last night. I dreamt the Republicans managed to pass a piece of legislation. EndOfSentence\\nJust heard Chris Christie got booed while performing CPR on a choking victim. EndOfSentence\\n\"OJ Simpson Paroled\" is by far the worst reboot of the summer. EndOfSentence\\nTrump hired Anthony Scaramucci because he thought his tan qualified him as a \"person of color.\" EndOfSentence\\nI miss Comic-Con so much today I went to the DMV just to wait in line.

EndOfSentence\\nI will only have sex with the lights out, the music on, and nobody else in the room. EndOfSentence\\nOne time I wore my brother’s t-shirt, and my dad asked if I was dressing up as his favorite child for Halloween.

EndOfSentence\\n.@KevinHart4Real thinks I have the body of Dutch woman. Watch as I prove him wrong.  EndOfSentence\\nI think it’s disgusting that my writers charge me more for Epipen jokes.

EndOfSentence\\nThis tweet is just a humblebrag that I can spell \"cantaloupe.\" EndOfSentence\\nMansplaining to this officer why I shouldn’t get a parking ticket.
